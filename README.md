### Crosscheck

The aim of CrossCheck is to provide the public with the necessary information to form their own conclusions about the information they receive. By working collaboratively, we hope to more quickly ascertain what is not factual or reliable, and to give that information to newsrooms and the public.

## Curriculum

### Mozilla's Mission:Information Curriculum

Mozilla's Mission:Information Curriculum is an open-source and interactive set of three lessons that help teens develop news and web literacy skills, and have some fun while doing so. This curriculum was created as a way to help teens deal with fake news and misinformation that they might encounter online. A main goal of this curriculum is to empower learners to become strong consumers, producers, and distributors of news and media.

## Tools

### Ask - From The Coral Porject

If you want to ask your audience a specific question to improve your reporting, you can give out your email, ask people to use social media or the comments box, or use a third-party form/survey tool.

None of these are built for the needs of journalists. Our Ask tool is.

### Talk - From The Coral Porject

Online comments are broken. Our Talk tool rethinks how moderation, comment display, and conversation function, creating the opportunity for safer, smarter discussions around your work.

### Proof-Mode

ProofMode is light, minimal "reboot" of our full encrypted, verified secure camera app, CameraV (guardianproject.info/apps/camerav). Our hope was to create a lightweight, almost invisible utility, that you can run all of the time on your phone, that automatically extra digital proof data to all photos and videos you take. This data can then be easily shared through a "Share Proof" share action, to anyone you choose.

### Video As Evidence

Through our Video as Evidence program, WITNESS collaborates with activists, human rights lawyers and international justice organizations to enhance the evidentiary value of video captured in the field.
